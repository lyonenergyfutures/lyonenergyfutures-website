I expect you'll want your income to increase by 5% next year, not by the 5 shillings your great grandfather might have welcomed. Many systems change at a rate that is proportional to their current size, rather than by fixed amounts. We call the latter type of system "linear". We call the former "exponential".

{{< figure src="/blog/img/exponential-growth.png" title="Exponential growth" >}}

Our brains are hardwired to deal with linear systems, like the closing distance of a pursuing sabre tooth tiger. An ancestor forced to process the exponentially increasing velocity of falling off a cliff didn't pass their genes on.

So exponential systems can have unexpected behaviours. And that's problematic, given the regularity with which we make and consume statements and predictions about two critical, massive ones---our financial system, and our energy system.

Here's some examples of that unexpected behaviour, in perhaps increasing order of strangeness.

Linear systems, obviously, increase in size by fixed amounts in equal time periods. 1,2,3,4,5. <strong>Exponential systems double in size in equal time periods. 1,2,4,8,16.</strong>

To work out the doubling time period, divide the growth rate into 70 (it comes from logs). So energy demand increasing at 2.3% per year (the current EIA estimate) doubles in 30 years. Then doubles again. Then again. <strong>Exponential systems generate absurdly large numbers in short periods of time from apparently small growth rates.</strong>

<strong>It works backwards to generate terrifyingly small numbers.</strong> For example, the IEA estimates the underlying annual depletion rate of the global petroleum system is passing though 10%. Without investment, it's halving every (70/10) 7 years. 100. 50. 25. 12. That's the rate the energy replacement escalator we climb is accelerating backwards, and the rate the energy that is assumed is available to build out millions of wind turbines and solar panels is diminishing.

Draw a series of squares with areas that successively double in size. All of the squares at any point will fit inside the next square you draw. <strong>In each doubling period, the total quantity produced is larger than the cumulative total of all production prior to that period.</strong> So at the currently forecasted rate of energy demand growth, in the next 30 years, we'll have to capitalise, develop, produce, and dispose of climate change pollutants of more energy than all the energy we've ever produced.

Time dilation effects are particularly strange, and I'll introduce a thought experiment to illustrate.

A mad person---say, a neoclassical economist who recently assured you that the finite size of the earth is a non-binding constraint on economic growth---has strapped you to the top seat of Wembley Stadium. She stands in the centre of the pitch and, in her hand, there is a magic drop of water that doubles in volume every minute.

Two questions: (i) when do you drown, and (ii) if you get worried when the stadium is half full of water, how long before you drown do you call the police?

The answer to (i) is about 47 minutes. The answer to (ii), having spent most of that time looking at a neoclassical economist standing in a puddle of water on the centre line, is one minute.

<strong>In bounded exponential systems, nothing happens for a long time. Then everything happens.</strong>

"What?"---you demand---"show me your estimate of the volume of Wembley Stadium!" It doesn't matter. If it's twice as big as I estimated, my forecast is out by ~2%. If it's four times bigger, the error is still ~2%.

In exponential systems, the time to exhaust a finite volume of stock, drawn down exponentially, is essentially independent of any estimate of the volume initially in place.

The implications of all this to an energy transition narrative that assumes continued exponential growth are, to put it mildly, profound:

- Having had little obvious warning of accumulating stress in our primary energy delivery systems, and saturated our atmosphere's waste disposal capacity, we now have to develop and produce more energy in the next 30 years than we've ever produced simply to maintain the stability of the financial system.

- The exhaustion time of our remaining hydrocarbon stocks is independent of our current estimates of them, or of efficiency improvements in the oil industry.

- Our estimates of the stocks of resources we'll need to substitute hydrocarbon as a fuel system in proposed replacement capital systems---energy, steel, cement, lithium, tantalum, water, etc---are superfluous.

Yet recognition of these implications in the transition narrative is largely absent. We say, in effect: "We'll think of something". And hopefully we will. But understanding the implications of exponential growth better might help us frame and devise energy transition strategies that have a better prospect of being viable.

For example. The significance and necessity of steady state economics becomes very clear. Spoiler alert: in a financial system that depends for stability on exponential growth the way a bike depends for stability on forward motion, steady state economics is exceptionally hard. Fortunately, the brightest minds coming out of economics schools now are focussing on it.

So to are the limits to optimism about so-called renewable energy technologies. Sunlight is indeed infinitely renewable. But the resources required to harness it aren't, and aren't infinite-acting as neoclassical economics led us to assume.

Above all, radical demand destruction as the foundation of energy policy starts to looks attractive---indeed, in the absence of interstellar travel capability, is perhaps the only rational approach available to us.

<strong>Fortunately, a whole range of politically acceptable demand destruction solutions---for example, passive housing---are available to us now and are ready to scale.</strong>

So there it is. The exponential function. Possibly the most important, least understood, and most lethal function in the energy and finance profess
