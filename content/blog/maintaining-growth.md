In previous essays, we looked at the numbers that apparently small energy demand growth and supply depletion rates generate (astronomical), and how much oil is likely to be left based on the historical pattern of discovery (far less than generally assumed).

Here's a quick recap of the theory, numbers, and assumptions we'll need before we look at the maths. 

We need continuously to discover, develop, and mobilise new oil resources to meet exponentially rising energy demand and fuel processing energy requirement, and to overcome exponential decline in existing production capacity. 

20 years ago, "peak demand" was all the rage, and still is. Neoclassical economists pointed to falling unit-energy demand in developed economies. Propelled by continuously improving energy efficiency policies and technologies, they claimed, total global energy demand would fall even as economic growth continued to rise.

It didn't, and probably won't, because of three major flaws in this argument: 

Firstly, the falling unit-energy demand observable in developed economies was the result of them exporting much of their energy intensive heavy industries (and emissions) to undeveloped countries which, being less efficient, perversely caused total energy demand (and emissions) required to "do stuff" to rise. 

Secondly, no-one told the 1.7 billion people born in the intervening period that they couldn't have food, light bulbs, cars, and next-day delivery of things made in China. 

Thirdly, to supply a given quantity of energy, an additional quantity of energy must be spent to process the fuel. The amount of additional energy is rising because the quality of sources of oil is falling rapidly. In 1901, banging a scaffold pole into Spindletop Hill with a mallet yielded 100 barrels of oil for every barrel spent getting it. Today, manufacturing an oil substitute from bitumen-contaminated sand in Alberta (or, as The BP Statistical Review of World Energy calls it, "Unconventional Oil") yields two barrels for every barrel. Consequently, any energy saved by efficiency improvements have been dwarfed by rising fuel processing energy demand.

So, rather than peaking, energy growth has continued to rise exponentially, and is currently around 1.2% per annum. Since the population is still rising, fuel source quality is still falling, and energy efficiency technology advances have not kept pace, there is no reason to suppose this is going to change any time soon.

ENERGY DEMAND INCREASE is relatively modest. The decline in existing production capacity is very much larger. To understand why, we need to understand a little bit about oil reservoir physics.

Before it is tapped, an oil reservoir is pressurised. Oil comes out of it rather as cola emerges from a shaken soda bottle. The rate it comes out at is proportional to the pressure. Unfortunately, as each barrel of oil is removed, the pressure available to expel the remaining barrels is reduced. So the rate of oil flow declines over time, and that decline rate is exponential.

The consequence of depletion is that, to maintain a given level of global annual production, new oil must be discovered, developed, and mobilised every year to replace the amount lost to depletion. 

We try and reduce that rate. To do that, we spend capital on various activities such as drilling more wells, injecting fluids to reduce pressure decline, etc.

This gives us two different numbers that can be used to describe the rate of production decline. The most common one is the observed decline rate, which is the rate of decline that we get after spending capital to slow it. The rarely used natural decline rate is the rate we'd get if we didn't spend any capital. If capital is the accelerator, and pressure decline is road and wind resistance, the natural decline rate is the rate our car would coast to a halt if we took our foot off the pedal. 

In gauging the magnitude of the oil depletion replacement task, the natural decline rate helps us disentangle highly uncertain commercial, economic, and political factors driving capital investment from reasonably certain physical factors. It's a more intuitive number to reason with.

So: what is the natural depletion rate? Well, new reservoirs often don't decline at all at first. Big old reservoirs decline slowly. Small old reservoirs decline quickly. The natural decline rate of the global petroleum system is the production weighted average of all of its reservoirs combined. 

Back in 2008, the IEA helpfully worked it out for us, and estimated the natural decline rate to be about 10% per annum [3]. That was 2008. Since the average reservoir size has been getting smaller over time, the natural depletion rate is rising over time and the current rate is higher than this.

Oil production that is falling at 10% per year is halving every 7 years. Annual oil production today is around 36 billion barrels. By 2026, natural depletion will halve that to 18 billion barrels. By 2033, it will be 9 billion. And so on.

WE'VE EVERYTHING WE NEED NOW to estimate an answer to the question: how much oil have we to find, develop, and mobilise between now and 2040 to maintain energy demand growth?

The table and graph below shows the numbers:

{{< figure src="/blog/img/gross-replacement-volume.png" title="Gross replacement volumes" >}}


Columns A and B show oil demand rising at 1.23%. Columns C and D show global supply capacity declining at a 10% per annum natural depletion rate (I'm using conservative numbers). Column E and F is the cumulative difference i.e. the net replacement oil volume. Column G is that volume grossed up via an estimate of the higher fuel processing energy requirements of the lower quality of future sources. Column H is a crude (orders of magnitude) estimate of cost.

It's twenty years since the start of this century. To maintain today's modest energy growth rate using oil for another twenty years will require the discovery, development, and mobilisation of nearly 630 billion barrels of oil. That's nearly 70% of all current and future discoveries of remaining oil stock. To put that figure in perspective, Rystad Energy estimates the industry discovered around 7 billion barrels of oil in 2017. 

Gas will undoubtedly play an increasingly important role in substituting for oil. However, gas cannot be substituted for oil in many services that are vital to industrial economies, such as manufacturing feedstocks and long distance transportation fuels. And gas is subject to its own brutal durability challenges when its stocks are drawn down and converted at exponentially rising rates.

What are we to make of this?

While detailed predictions are often a fool's errand, I think some broad contours can be sketched from this helicopter view: 

1. Stripped back to the natural depletion rate, the sheer scale of the replacement challenge is revealed, and it's immense. This is a volume that is more than two times higher than claimed Saudi reserves, but obtained from many sources that are very significantly poorer in quality and harder to develop than Saudi reserves. The discovery, development, and mobilisation rates implied by this volume in this timescale have no historical precedent. 

2. The implied funding requirement in a heavily debt-laden global economy contemplating a massive simultaneous buildout of cripplingly expensive renewable energy technologies is multiples of known industry capital investment plans. Historical production cost metrics don't include carbon mitigation costs. An allowance of, say, $5/bbl for carbon capture and storage would price carbon mitigation of replacement volumes at $3 trillion over 20 years, with no in-project financial benefit to relieve project economics. There is no evidence that the global economy can service the combined capital requirements of the renewable and fossil fuel industries, or tolerate the energy cost increases imposed by both, without severe stress.

3. There appears to be no plausible rate of fossil fuel project capital investment and execution, no rate of renewable energy technology substitution, and no rate of managed demand destruction, that can keep up with the bottom of the global oil delivery system halving every 7 years. If this is so, then we are heading for unmanaged supply contraction and demand constraint, with all that implies for a debt-burdened, energy growth dependent financial system.

Conventional global oil forecast analysis has relied on assumptions derived from more optimistic 'observed' decline rates, which have capital conversion rates 'baked-in'. Much of the capital supporting the observed decline rates since 2008 has been generated under emergency monetary policies based on low or negative interest rates and money printing, and which are likely unsustainable in the long run. As a result, the full extent of the energy cliff we are approaching has been concealed, and is therefore not fully reflected in current energy transition plans.

This is a serious defect.

Properly understood, timescales for oil replacement and renewable system build-outs appear to be far too long. The scale, cost, and required pace of carbon emission mitigation is significantly underestimated, as is the imminence and scale of the flight into coal and other fuels of last resort that it is reasonable to suppose will be the inevitable response to the disruptions created by any uncontrolled energy contraction. That contraction itself threatens the availability of energy and stability of the financial system that all investment in energy transition schemes depend on.

Against this backdrop, an energy transition plan that explicitly reprioritises controlled demand destruction might make more sense.
